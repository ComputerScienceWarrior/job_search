# JobSearch

The JobSearch program is a handy program for anyone looking for a job or a gig from craigslist.com. 
The user would first be prompted to choose from a category of jobs to inspect further. After making a 
selection, the user would then receive a list of all jobs currently posted for that category. Afterwards,
the user is provided with the job link, and given more options, with the ability to view the job details 
with more specificity. When finished inspecting the job, the user is given the option to view another 
category, or end the program entirely.
